# HTML Menu Conversion - COMPLETE! ✅

## What Changed

### **BEFORE (Canvas-Only):**
- ❌ All menus drawn on canvas
- ❌ Click detection using coordinate math
- ❌ Hard to click buttons

- ✅ Canvas only for gameplay
- ✅ Clicks work perfectly!
- ✅ No coordinate detection needed

## New Architecture

### **HTML Screens (Real Clickable Elements):**
1. **Main Menu** - 5 real buttons (Play, Shop, Level Select, Stats, How to Play)
2. **Shop** - Real ability boxes and upgrade buttons
3. **Level Select** - 30 level boxes in grid
4. **Stats** - Speedrun records display
5. **How to Play** - Instructions
6. **Victory Overlay** - Buttons over canvas (Next Level, Shop, Retry)
7. **Defeat Overlay** - Buttons over canvas (Retry, Shop, Menu)

### **Canvas (Gameplay Only):**
- Player (blue block)
- Boss (red enemy)
- Bullets
- HUD (health, coins, time)
- Pause screen

## Files Changed

### **New Files:**
- `game/htmlMenus.js` - Manages all HTML menu interactions

### **Modified Files:**
- `popup.html` - Added all HTML menu screens + victory/defeat overlays
- `popup.css` - Added styles for buttons, grids, overlays
- `popup.js` - Initialize HTMLMenuManager
- `game/engine.js` - Simplified to only render canvas during gameplay

## How It Works

### **State Management:**
```
MENU → Show mainMenu HTML, hide canvas
SHOP → Show shopScreen HTML, hide canvas  
LEVEL_SELECT → Show levelSelectScreen HTML, hide canvas
STATS → Show statsScreen HTML, hide canvas
HOW_TO_PLAY → Show howToPlayScreen HTML, hide canvas
PLAYING → Show canvas, hide all HTML menus
VICTORY → Keep canvas visible, show victoryOverlay HTML on top
DEFEAT → Keep canvas visible, show defeatOverlay HTML on top
```

### **Button Click Flow:**
```
User clicks "Shop" button
  ↓
HTML button click event fires
  ↓
htmlMenus.onShopClick() called
  ↓
Updates game.state = 'SHOP'
  ↓
Shows shopScreen HTML
  ↓
User clicks ability box
  ↓
HTML click event fires
  ↓
Buys/equips ability
  ↓
Updates display
```
