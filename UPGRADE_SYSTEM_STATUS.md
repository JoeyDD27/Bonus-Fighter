## ⚠️ REMAINING TO IMPLEMENT

### Critical Features
- ⏳ **Boss Scaling** - Bosses need to scale with player upgrades
- ⏳ **UI Buttons** - Victory/defeat screens need proper clickable buttons
- ⏳ **Animations** - Boss intro animations (30) + phase transitions (5)

### Boss Scaling Details Needed
- Early bosses (1-15): Weak scaling (maxed player dominates)
- Mid bosses (16-25): Medium scaling
- Late bosses (26-30): Strong scaling (fair for maxed player)

### UI Buttons Needed
Victory screen:
- "Next Level" button
- "Retry" button
- "Shop" button
- "Menu" button

Defeat screen:
- "Retry" button
- "Shop" button
- "Menu" button

### Animations Needed
- 30 boss intro animations (4 seconds each)
- 5 phase transition animations (bosses 20, 29, 30)
- See BOSS_ANIMATIONS.md for complete details

## 📊 Implementation Progress

**Completed:** ~80%
**Remaining:** ~20%

**Files Created:** 3 (abilities.js, quests.js, shop.js, BOSS_ANIMATIONS.md, this file)
**Files Modified:** 7 (storage.js, player.js, engine.js, ui.js, manifest.json, popup.html, bosses.js)

## Next Steps

1. Implement boss scaling formula
2. Add proper UI buttons to victory/defeat screens
3. Implement boss intro and phase animations
4. Test complete flow
5. Balance and polish

The core upgrade system is functional! Players can now:
- Earn coins by beating levels and getting stars
- Buy abilities in the shop
- Equip one ability of each type
- Upgrade their stats (health and damage)
- Complete quests for extra coins
- Use abilities with E and R keys

The game is playable with the new systems, but needs the remaining features for polish and balance.
